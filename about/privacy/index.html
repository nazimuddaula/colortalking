							<header>
								<h4>Data we collect</h4>
								<p>It's your personal data but not so PERSONAL</p>
							</header>
							<p>We collect data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences with our brands and products. You provide some of this data directly, such as when you create an account with us, submit a texts or images to our platforms, type something with our keyboards or contact us for support. We get some of it by recording how you interact with our products by, for example, using technologies like cookies, and receiving error reports or usage data from software running on your device. We also obtain data from third parties.</p>
							<p>We also collect information about how you use our Services, such as the types of content you view or engage with or the frequency and duration of your activities.</p>
							<p>We collect information from or about the computers, phones, or other devices where you install or access our products, depending on the permissions you’ve granted. We may associate the information we collect from your different devices, which helps us provide consistent services across your devices. Here are some examples of the device information we collect: 
								<ul>
									<li>Attributes such as the operating system, hardware version, device settings, file and software names and types, battery and signal strength, and device identifiers.</li>
									<li>Device locations, including specific geographic locations, such as through GPS, Bluetooth, or WiFi signals.</li>
									<li>Connection information such as the name of your mobile operator or ISP, browser type, language and time zone, mobile phone number and IP address.</li>
								</ul>

							<header>
								<h4>The way we use the data</h4>
								<p>Well, it's mostly about improving the experience</p>
							</header>
							<p>We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect us and our users. We also may use the data to communicate with you, for example, informing you about your account, security updates and product information.</p>
							<p>When we have location information, we use it to tailor our services for you and others, like helping you to get localize information or offers in your area. We conduct surveys and research, test features in development, and analyze the information we have to evaluate and improve products and services, develop new products or features, and conduct audits and troubleshooting activities.</p>
						</section>
						<hr />
						<section>
							<header>
								<h4>How this information is shared</h4>
								<p>We share it internally and with some trusted partners</p>
							</header>
							<p>We share your personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized. We also share data with our affiliates and subsidiaries; with vendors working on our behalf; when required by law or to respond to legal process; to protect our customers; to protect lives; to maintain the security of our products; and to protect the rights or property of Color Talking.</p>
							<p>We want our advertising to be as relevant and interesting as the other information you find on our services. With this in mind, we use all of the information we have about you to show you relevant ads. We do not share information that personally identifies you with advertising, measurement or analytics partners unless you give us permission.</p>
							<p>We transfer information to vendors, service providers, and other partners who globally support our business, such as providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our services are used, measuring the effectiveness of ads and services, providing customer service, facilitating payments, or conducting academic research and surveys. These partners must adhere to strict confidentiality obligations in a way that is consistent with this Data Policy and the agreements we enter into with them.</p>
						</section>
						<hr />
						<section>
							<header>
								<h4>Control your personal data</h4>
								<p>It's about accessing and updating your information</p>
							</header>
							<p>Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.</p>
							<p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.</p>
							<p>We store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you and others, including those described above. Information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted, unless we no longer need the data to provide products and services.</p>
							<p>You can delete your account any time. When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and status updates.</p>
						</section>
						<hr />
						<section>
							<header>
								<h4>Compliance and cooperation with regulatory authorities</h4>
								<p>Because we're living in a civilized world</p>
							</header>
							<p>We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere to several self regulatory frameworks, including the <a href="http://foo.run/a8zw" target="_blank">ICT Laws of Bangladesh</a>. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up.</p>
							<p>We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.</p>
							<p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of Bangladesh where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.</p>

						<hr />
						<section>

								<h4>Revisions and changes</h4>
								<p>It's a moving world and change brings improvements</p>
							</header>

We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice including email notification of privacy policy changes.</p>
